      <h1>Mindfulness Reflections</h1>

      <h2>
        Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you
        describe them?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I have so much passion for mindfulness! It's been an integral pillar of
        my wellness journey for about 8 years now. It's an area that I have
        explored greatly and continue to do so. One thing I will say is that
        mindfulness is a cognitive based practice. At some point in our journey
        I believe it's important to bring body-based practices into the fold.
        Research is showing more and more that the body holds our story. With
        leaders such as Gabor Mate and Bessel Van Der Kolk it's becoming clear
        that we need to establish and integrate mindfulness pracices that
        incorporate the felt sence.

      <h2>How did you find the overall experience?</h2>

      <p>
        Well when I first started it was very confronting, and it set me off on
        a chain of major life descisions that drastically changed who am I am -
        in all aspects of my life. It's transformative. I also find it
        enriching, mindfulness has bought depth, meaning and fulfilment to my
        life. It's also bought me frustration. At times I wish I didn't swallow
        the red pill and could go back to ignorance as bliss haha.
      </p>

      <h2>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?</h2>

      <p>
        Mediation twice a day (morning + night). I do Being meditation which is
        a version of Vedic meditation.
      </p>

      <h1>Listening and Looping</h1>

      <h2>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h2>

      <p>
        Heaven. Being heard is hot! It's healing actually. We don't listen
        enough.
      </p>

      <h2>What was it like to fully listen?</h2>

      <p>
        Anxiety reducing haha. Instead trying to multi-task and think about what
        I'm going to say in return I can just relax and listen. HEAVEN!
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
