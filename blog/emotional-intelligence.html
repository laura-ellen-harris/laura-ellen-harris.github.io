      <h1>EQ & IQ</h1>

      <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>

      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is your ability to understand your emotions,
        thoughts and feels. It directly related to the inner landscape of your
        felt sense experience, rather than the logical. Emotions are irrational
        and sometimes linked to past experiences we are unaware of in our
        conscious minds. Therefore the better we understand our emotional
        triggers, and how to recourse ourselves the better we are able to
        navigate this wild, wild world!
      </p>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

      <p>
        IQ is understanding cognitive intelligence and logic (how to get from A
        to B). EQ is understanding your emotions and inner landscape (how you
        feel about going from A to B). Back in the day, we had high EQ as we had
        to be attuned to the wind and the water to survive. Emotional
        intelligence requires us to feel, listen and be with ~ a skill that has
        been lost over the millenniums. Now IQ is more widely known and
        celebrated due it’s ability to make us more productive ($$$$). If we
        just bulldoze over our EQ, and use our IQ to rationalise our way through
        life, we’ll be fine right? Clearly not. Hence why EQ is having a
        comeback!
      </p>

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

      <p>
        Ummm. Well, how long do you have? I’m bias but IQ-only living is dull.
        This is why people make it to the top and then wonder why they are so
        miserable. EQ is what enables the depth of connection, fulfilment and
        meaning that we need as humans to live healthy, thriving lives. Life is
        relationships. Relationship to your partner, colleagues, family,
        environment, spirit and self. To have functional relationships you need
        to know yourself intimately. You can’t assert your boundaries if you
        don’t know what they are. You can't tell someone what you like in the
        bedroom if you don’t know what you like. You can’t attract what you want
        in your life if you don’t know what you want. You can be on autopilot ~
        lots of people are, but you’ll hit the ceiling quickly and start to seek
        that primal urge of fulfilment in other (and sometimes destructive)
        ways.
      </p>

      <h1>Mindfulness Reflections</h1>

      <h2>
        Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you
        describe them?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I have so much passion for mindfulness! It's been an integral pillar of
        my wellness journey for about 8 years now. It's an area that I have
        explored greatly and continue to do so. One thing I will say is that
        mindfulness is a cognitive based practice. At some point in our journey
        I believe it's important to bring body-based practices into the fold.
        Research is showing more and more that the body holds our story. With
        leaders such as Gabor Mate and Bessel Van Der Kolk it's becoming clear
        that we need to establish and integrate mindfulness pracices that
        incorporate the felt sence.
      </p>

      <h2>How did you find the overall experience?</h2>

      <p>
        Well when I first started it was very confronting, and it set me off on
        a chain of major life descisions that drastically changed who am I am -
        in all aspects of my life. It's transformative. I also find it
        enriching, mindfulness has bought depth, meaning and fulfilment to my
        life. It's also bought me frustration. At times I wish I didn't swallow
        the red pill and could go back to ignorance as bliss haha.
      </p>

      <h2>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?</h2>

      <p>
        Mediation twice a day (morning + night). I do Being meditation which is
        a version of Vedic meditation.
      </p>

      <h1>Listening and Looping</h1>

      <h2>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h2>

      <p>
        Heaven. Being heard is hot! It's healing actually. We don't listen
        enough.
      </p>

      <h2>What was it like to fully listen?</h2>

      <p>
        Anxiety reducing haha. Instead trying to multi-task and think about what
        I'm going to say in return I can just relax and listen. HEAVEN!
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
