      <h1>Understanding Classes vs. IDs in HTML and CSS</h1>

      <p>
        In the wild world of web development, HTML and CSS are the foundation
        for creating fancy, frilly and functional websites. Two important
        concepts to grasp are classes and IDs. In this blog post, we'll explore
        the difference between classes and IDs and provide simple examples to
        help you understand how to use them effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Classes and IDs in HTML: In HTML, classes and IDs are attributes that
        can be assigned to elements to define their styles and behaviour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Classes: A class is a way to group elements together based on a shared
        characteristic or purpose. By assigning the same class name to multiple
        elements, you can apply the same styles to all of them.
      </p>

      <!--example-->
      <h2>Here's an example:</h2>

      <img src="../images/code-1.png" alt="hero image" class="main-image" />

      <p>
        In the code above, the div element has the class "highlight". Any CSS
        styles associated with the "highlight" class will be applied to all the
        elements within that div. This allows you to maintain consistent styling
        across multiple elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        IDs: An ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific element. Unlike
        classes, each ID should only be used once in an HTML document. IDs are
        useful when you want to style or target a specific element individually.
      </p>
      <h2>Here's an example:</h2>
      <img src="../images/code-2.png" alt="hero image" class="main-image" />

      <p>
        In this example, the h2 element has the ID "page-title". With this
        unique identifier, you can easily style this specific heading element
        using CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best Practices: To use classes and IDs effectively, keep the following
        best practices in mind:
      </p>

      <h2>Classes:</h2>
      <p>Use classes to group entire elements with a specified CSS style.</p>
      <p>
        Choose an appropriate class name that reflects the purpose of that
        element group.
      </p>
      <p>
        classes whenever possible to maintain consistency, simplicity, and to
        avoid code duplication.
      </p>

      <h2>IDs:</h2>
      <p>Assign IDs to elements that require individual styling.</p>
      <p>
        Assign and ID to an element within a class to specify a unique styling
        element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use specific and meaningful ID names that accurately represent the
        element's purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Combining Classes and IDs: You can also combine classes and IDs to
        create more precise styling options.
      </p>

      <h2>For example:</h2>

      <img src="../images/code-3.png" alt="hero image" class="main-image" />

      <p>
        Here, the div has the ID "header," while the h1 and nav elements have
        the classes "title" and "navigation" respectively. This allows you to
        style both the entire header and its individual elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding how to use classes and IDs in HTML and CSS is fundamental
        for building well-structured and visually appealing web pages. Classes
        help group elements with shared styles, while IDs provide unique
        identifiers for individual elements. By following best practices and
        using them appropriately, you can create cohesive and visually
        consistent websites.
