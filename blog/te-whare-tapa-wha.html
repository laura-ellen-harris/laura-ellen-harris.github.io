  <h3>3 July 2023</h3>

    <p>
      Here is my well-being plan for my time at Devacademy. I can go a little OTT, so I’ve created a menu of sorts for each wall. Life changes, weather changes, I’m a woman so my energy levels change throughout the month. It’s vital for me to be able to cater to my cycle and choose an option from a menu that varies in time, energy output, accessibility etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)
      Gym 5 days a week (before or after school). Exercises can vary and be tailored to which phase of my cycle I am in. When I’m ovulating I can do higher-intensity workouts. When I’m in my luteal phase I like to do yoga and pilates rather than heavy weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Walking my dog along the beach ( I live in Devonport). Connecting to the waters is a crucial part of my overall wellbeing, as well as spending quality time with my dog. Over winter when the days are shorter I may only get one beach walk in a day, and that’s okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Grooming & hygiene - Presentation is important to me and I like to take pride in how look. I don’t mean affluent fashion glam, I’m referring to taking the time to shower, do my hair and wear clothes that represent me.
    </p>

  <h2>Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</h2>

    <p>
      - I see a therapist every week. I call it mental hygiene, it’s just as important as going to the dentist.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Compassion and positive self-talk, especially when things get tough.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Mediation, twice daily.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Staying organised by writing lists, using organisational tools and not overcommitting or putting too much on my plate.
    </p>

  <h2>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
      - My spirituality is accessed through embodiment practice and nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Dancing (5 rhythms or ecstatic dance)
    </p>

    <p>
      - Embodiment practice at home (guided audio)
    </p>

    <p>
      - Long walks through the bush, hikes in the mountains, and walking along the beach with my dog.
    </p>

  <h2>Taha whānau (family wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        - Checking in with parents on the phone.
        Having dinners, walks and cups of tea with friends.
      </p>

      <P>
        - Cooking at home and sharing meals with friends on weeknights.
        Making plans to do memorable things with friends and family (something to look forward to)
      </P>

      <P>
        - Deepening connections through intentional intimacy and focussing on loving each other.
      </P>
