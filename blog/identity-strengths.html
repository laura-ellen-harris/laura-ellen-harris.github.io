      <h1>My Strengths & Identity</h1>
      <h2>
        Here's what I've learnt about myself so far.
        <em>Ever evolving. Ever growing.</em>
      </h2>
      <h3>25 June 2023</h3>

      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a therapist I facilitate and host group sessions. Naturally, these
        group sessions are culturally diverse. I wanted to create a safe,
        inclusive space where everyone could share and identify freely with the
        cultural rituals and traditions that they were accustomed to - including
        myself. A lot of my inclusivity training was based around Maori and
        Pacifica culture, which I enjoyed and complete still to this day.
        Although, I found that my own culture wasn’t represented when I
        facilitated a space to cater only to Maori and Pacifica.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did some research and asked for guidance from my mentors. I weighed up
        all of the contributing factors and have since made a wonderful
        framework that honours all cultures and traditions that come to my space
        - while still remaining in integrity with my own ethnicity and values of
        free self-expression.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’m white, able-bodied and privileged. In my earlier years, I definitely
        absorbed some internalised racism from my parents. Recently however I’ve
        been surrounded by lots of people who are passionate about all cultures
        and they’ve inspired me to learn about my own cultural history of the
        Paegen and Viking lineages. It’s been amazing to have a line to refer
        back to, being NZ pakeha European can be misplacing at times, so to have
        connected back this way has been so beneficial for my own sense of
        identity. This influences my values of honouring our cultural lineage.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are discipline, structure and drive. I’ve been a business
        owner for many years now so I know that it’s important to show up and do
        the work, even when we’d rather sleep in or go for a hike!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I can get tired and overwhelmed. Right now I’m experiencing a lot of
        financial pressure which is adding to my stress, so I may have to make
        some bigger decisions like moving house. This can be very disorienting
        for me and ungrounding. I need to make sure I’m keeping things simple
        and doing what I need to do to stay positive and resourced.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that being a business owner has impacted my ability to find work
        that inspires me as I haven’t had a lot of corporate experience. I think
        that having a beginners mindset will be beneficial, and being prepared
        to start slow and work my way up will be exciting and rewarding!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Typically I find that I’m a good communicator and don’t sweep things
        under the rug. If there is tension or resistance within a group dynamic,
        I typically confront it straight away in a face-to-face conversation.
        People can find this intimidating, but eventually, with some compassion
        and empathy, we can usually reach an understanding and solution.
        Sometimes bringing in a third party is helpful also.
