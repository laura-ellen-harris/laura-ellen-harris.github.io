      <h1>Neuroplasticity and Adopting a Growth Mindset</h1>

      <h2>Neuroplasticity:</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial as it
        enables people to take control of their learning and life with an
        approach that is achievable. If science affirms to us that we can learn
        anything, or “reprogram” the way our brain thinks and performs, then
        that in turn fulfils us with a can-do attitude aka self belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by reconising
        that I’m in the drivers seat of my learning and life. By building new
        and robust neural pathways in my brain, I can lean and become competent
        at anything I set my mind to (with dedication and practice, that is).
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of ways I can help increase neuroplasticity are by maintaining a
        sense of newness for my brain ie walking new trails to work, or learning
        a new skill. Other ways are physical exercise, hydration, and
        cognitive-based mindfulness tools such as meditation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A resource that I use regularity for neurplacitiy (information and
        action) is a neural manifestation platform called TBM. TBM is a hypnosis
        method that allows you to access root causes for certain neural
        structures (though patterns and beliefs) and reprogram them with new,
        more supportive beliefs. It’s amazing!

      <h2>Growth Mindset:</h2>

      <p>
        A growth mindset is a fundamental belief that we are capable of
        learning, developing and evolving. It’s important to adopt and maintain
        a growth mindset as it enables us to explore, expand and achieve things
        in our lifetime. Humans WANT to evolve, it is our nature, although I’d
        like to add that adopting a growth mindset is not as easy as flicking a
        switch. Many people experience challenging upbringings, or traumatic
        events (early childhood as well as adulthood) that in inhibit our sense
        of self belief, therefore eroding our sense of ability and self esteem.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who have experienced trauma loose resilience and tend to lean
        toward a fixed mindset as they don’t have an intrinsic sense of safety
        or security. For some, making mistakes can feel life threatening and
        have sever consequences on a nervous system level.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is also relevant to people who are highly sensitive. If you’d like
        to learn more,

      </p>

      <p>
        It’s complex stuff that unique to every individual, so compassion is
        needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this exploration, what I noticed is how far away I am from my own
        “practice” of self belief and mindfulness. I mediatte daily and have
        good health habbits, but life can sometimes become overwhelming and I
        often fall victim to fixed thinking. In my personal experience,
        neuroplaciicity and growth mindset is a choice, but to do it well it
        takes A LOT of consistent awareness, focus and energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’d like to integrate a growth mindset on my journey by giving myself
        permission to be in an exploration phase, trust that I can adapt and
        evolve in challenging circumstances and choose to carve out time for
        reflection, inventory and mindfulness (journall, meditation, play etc).
        It’s important that I try to let go of control, allow myself to make
        mistakes, pivot or choose another direction if I want to.
      </p>

      <p>
        After doing this exercise I reflected on my learning plan and it has
        reenforced how important ti is for me to be careful with extra
        curricular activities, and make sure I’m using my spare time to reflect
        and rescouce. I’m moving to Auckland in a couple of weeks which is a big
        move for me. So I need to make sure that I’m balancnig my time well and
        if I notice myself getting into fixed thinking, I can revert back to the
        self belief of adaptability and growth as set out prior in this blog.
