    <h1>Hello my my non-techy friend!
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Let me tell you a kiiiind of funny, yet mostly distressing story about my experience in learning (basic) Javascript.
    </h2>
    <h1>1.</h1>

    <p>
      Let’s start with a time I got blocked on a simple problem (this literally happened every step of the way lol, but I’ll use one time in this blog so that I don’t write a novel).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first problem I got stuck on was the Super Fizzbuzz challenge. I was quickly overwhelmed and couldn’t understand the scope or the task at hand. So I spent a lot of time procrastinating. Once I got my A into G, I had a chat with my teacher briefly where she let me in on a little secret saying that “fizzbuzz is all over the internet”... And so off I went!
    </p>
    <p>
      I started doing research on the fizzbuzz challenge and coding solutions. Once I got my head around the traditional challenge I could then scope out the super fizz buzz challenge. I mostly leaned on research here as my predominant problem-solving technique.
    </p>

    <p>My tests were having an issue running as I accidentally deleted some of the test code (whoops!) so I had a call with Gerard to get back on track.</p>

    <p>Once I got the test running and started to read where the error were on which line, that helped me define where the issues were and research how to correct them either in MDN WebDocs or on some of the YouTube tutorials Joseph & Gerad did this week.
    </p>

    <p>I’d also used chat as my in-pocket tutor, and asked it to explain certain elements or functions to me like I’m a 7year old. I found this super helpful as it supported my learning and saved me trawling the internet for articles. I was able to get specific, targeted answers to my questions. I still had to translate the chat answers into the fizzbuzz challenge, so that really supported my learning.</p>

    <p>I used the rubber ducky method a lot (thank god I live alone!) and would talk out loud the code and all of it’s functions and how they reference and relate to one another. I’d also put my finished code into chat and get it to break it down for me step by step and then I’d read it aloud to further solidify my learning.</p>

    <p>I went on a rollercoaster of emotions. Mostly I feel like I don’t understand, but reassure myself that I’m right where I need to be and it’s a matter of practice that will help me get it.</p>

    <p>I use this example because the ‘simple problem’ was actually getting started.
    </p>

    <h1>2.</h1>

    <p>Then there was a time when I managed to solve a problem elegantly!
    </p>

    <p>This was in the Built-in Method challenge. I started with the first challenge capitalize and quickly recognise what I had to research to solve the problem (practice made better!). I also remember watching Gerard's Zoom call with the Woof tests. So I went straight to the woof tests and solved them there, using MDN Web Docs and chat to help me get clarity with any questions I had.
    </p>

    <p>From there, I felt like I had the resources I needed to pseudo-code, and then create the answer.
    </p>

    <p>I felt relieved as this felt a lot easier than the previous challenges!
    </p>

    <p>What I’m struggling with is feeling like I’m cheating if I’m using code from intenret resources. I guess I need to translate it from the internet examples into the specific task at hand, but I felt a moral dilemma with this.
    </p>

    <p>I definitely had a lot of syntax errors come up in my tests. I found it time-consuming and frustrating, I wonder if practice will help me get the correct syntax and order of things.
    </p>

    <h1>3.</h1>

    <h2>Here are my personal reflections on these problem-solving techniques:
    </h2>

    <p>Pseudocode - This was interesting. I’d start with some basic ideas, but then as I did more research and worked my way through the challenge I’d add to it and change it. I don’t yet look at a challenge and go “oh, obviously i need to do x, y, z in this specific order”. I’m not there yet haha.</p>

    <p>Trying something - I did this a lot with syntax errors. I adjusted uppercase, changed brackets, added commas etc. I’d make a change and run a test, and keep going. It’s frustrating and inefficient. But eventually, I’d get there.</p>

    <p>Rubber ducky method - I did this a lot. Speaking things loud helps me clarify what I’m trying to do. I also did it in reverse order, once i had solved the problem I’d explain what I did aloud to further anchor my learning.</p>

    <p>Reading error messages - I’d reach the error message and type itno google or chat. This helped me get clarity and understand what it’s telling me.</p>

    <p>Console.logging - I didn’t do this in this challenge as there wasn’t a browser to check it on.</p>

    <P>Googling - I googled a lot, but I found it overwhelming and time consuming to find the specific answer. I’d usually go to MDN or ask chat, as it give specific answers to my question.</P>

    <p>Asking your peers for help - I asked a couple of questions in discord, especially with my tests. But I didn’t do it that often…
    </p>

    <p>Asking coaches for help - I had a call with my coach after our group call this week but felt like I needed to just ‘give it go myself’. I’m glad I did! Gerard also helped me a lot with tech questions!</p>

    <p>Improving your process with reflection - If I’m honest I didn’t have a lot of time for reflection as I was already way over the slotted time allowance for every challenge. This blog has been reflective. I think the practice has made it easier for me to scop an issue and create a streamlined process to solve it.
    </p>

    <h1>4.</h1>

    <p>I think throughout this whole process I felt reluctant to ask for help because I felt like I would just be annoying. I also felt like it would be time-consuming as I’d need to set up a time to get support etc. I found that I could use chat as a tutor so I’d go to chat instead… interesting huh! If we were in a classroom I’d much prefer to ask peers and my teacher. I resist because I feel like I’m not getting it and will need a lot of hand-holding and take up too much of the teacher's time… So I guess there is some shame there, and the story I’m telling myself is “I suck at this!”.</p>

    <p>Crazy to reflect on that.
    </p>

    <p>Logically I know it’s not true. But funny how these little beliefs sneak up on us without even realising it!
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
