    <h1>Core Learnings</h1>


    <h2> What are three new things you learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
     1. I have a good amount of resilience! Even though I have bad where I seriously question my decisions, I don’t get angry or frustrated and am able to stay calm. I’m really proud of that!</p>

    <p>2. I am afraid to reach out for help because my imposter syndrome doesn’t want me to look like a dummy.</p>

    <p>That I have good self-reflection skills and am able to manage negative self-talk.</p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>

    <p>The roles values, empathy and self-awareness play in programming I’d say is being able to manage challenges and frustrations, as well as communicate effectively, especially when you start to work in groups.</p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>

    <p>I’ve mostly been surprised that this content is included in the programme, to be honest! Personally, I think it’s been a real test of my self-awareness and self-compassion, I was surprised to witness my self-talk around learning and not feeling 100% competent at a task. I typically pick things up quickly and consider myself very capable, coding has been hugely challenging and mindbending, so I feel very humbled. </p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>

    <p>I can’t think of any challenges in the core learning… Sometimes I’d feel so behind in the technical sections so I’d get frustrated and skim on the core learning because “I’ve been there, done that” which is not a mindset I keep for very long... I always came around to it and enjoyed it once I started. </p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>

    <p>Because EQ is the real flex. As programmers, we need interpersonal skills to have a thriving team.</p>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

    <p>NO, I LOVED IT! As I mentioned above, I definitely had days where I felt like I didn’t have time for it, but I feel like it is so valuable to do, so I’m 100% here for it.</p>
