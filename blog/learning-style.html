      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>
        My long-term career pathway is to be a team leader, mentor or manager in
        a company that is driving positive change for the planet and it’s
        people. With my current skillset in leadership, facilitation and team
        management i feel I’m greatly suited for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths when it comes to learning are being driven, reliable and
        self-responsible. Due to my prior experience of being a business owner I
        know how to implement structure, routine and supportive aids to assist
        my learning and productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My weaknesses are that I can rush through things and focus more on
        efficiency instead of quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to go the extra mile and ensure that what I’m learning is
        sticking, and that I’m focussing on mastery rather than getting it done
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at Dev academy i’d like to develop my technical skill in coding,
        enabling me to find a suitable entry-level position so that I can work
        towards my greater goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I am working through this program I have committed myself to
        working full time on Dev Academy and am only seeing 2-3 clients a week
        (5-6 hours).
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to work safely and productively with teams mates and facilitators
        by try my best to problem solve myself first, making sure I have
        grounded myself and scoped out the issue before reaching out. I imagine
        coding can get frustrating, so practicing patience and not letting it
        mean anything to me on a personal level is important. Moreover, not
        taking the frustration out on others, especially teachers, is very
        important! In the theme of leadership, I feel it’s important to be
        vulnerable and honest while taking responsibility for our emotions and
        not throwing them around for others to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a lady of leisure, and I’m always committed to finding balance in my
        work/play life. I recognise that this course is a big learning
        commitment, and there will be a stressful period. In the past, I have
        let stress overwhelm me and it can weigh me down emotionally, this time
        I plan to maintain an “acceptance approach” where it’s okay to feel
        overwhelmed and to take small breaks when I need to. I’m also mindful of
        simplifying my life to ensure I have enough space for things that
        nourish me and keep me resourced such as early nights, healthy food,
        meditation and exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I’m struggling, I won’t hesitate to ask for help. I’m a therapist so…
        I know how valuable support is! Even if it’s talking to a facilitator
        about what I’m struggling with in the course can be so valuable, as they
        help to give perspective (and some validation, haha!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t have set expectations from the facilitation team, but what I’ve
        discovered so far is that they are professionals that show up and are
        very generous with their time, while also having boundaries and respect.
        So my expectation is that they’ll do their best to support students,
        while also allowing us the opportunity to work through issues on our own
        and empowering us to find solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of scheduling, I’m going with the ol’ classic 9-5 approach.
        With that being said, I’m an early riser and I like to ‘get stuck in’.
        So typically I’ll be up and studying from 730ish-230ish. I like to be
        flexible, so if I’m needing a longer lunch break i’ll take it etc. I
        don’t make plans with friend or family during the day as I’m studying.
