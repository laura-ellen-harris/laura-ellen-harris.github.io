  <h1>JavaScript, DOM… WTF?</h1>
  <h2>
    Don’t worry… I felt exactly the same when i first heard these terms! The I saw the code and woah, it’s been a mind bend. But I’m here to ease you into these concepts in a way that will make you feel like a light fluffy cloud (hopefully). Let’s get started!

  <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS:</h2>

    <p>
    Okay so if HTML is the bones, CSS is the flesh and fashion, Javascript is basically the brain that tells the body what to do, how to move and how to function internation internally and how to navigate the world around it!

    Essentially JavaScript is the functionality of a site or application. Without it, a website’s life would be pretty boring!
    </p>

  <h2>Control Flow:</h2>

    <p>
      Control flow is pretty much what is sounds like ~ you’re controlling the flow! As in, you’e controlling the sequence of which the computer reads and actions your code. When you write a list of to-do’s, if you’re logical and organised you’ll most like order your to-do list in priorities or any specific order in which you need to do the tasks (you want to get groceries before you cook dinner etc). This is what control flow is, organising and ordering your code so that it is read in the appropriate order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar to a road map, you want to code in a way that is simple and easy for your computer to read. For example, when using id, else… You’re basically telling your computer if the value of x = y, then do x. If the value of x doesn’t = y, then do z.
    </p>

  <h2>Loops:</h2>

    <p>
      I’ll be honest… Loops have thrown me for a loop so I’ll do my best to explain them here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Essentially a JavaScript loop is a way to tell your computer to “do this and then do that”. This is really handy if you want to automate commands, without writing them out over and over (that would be… messy and, basically a disaster!). It basically a command that will tell your computer to do a set of tasks (or a loop of tasks) saving you time and effort.
    </p>

  <h2>DOM, kinky or confusing?</h2>

    <p>
      Well, we could make this a BDSM analogy but I think I’ll keep this blog post PG rated for now.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let’s clarify what DOM stands for Document Object Model. So it’s kind of a family tree of all the working files inside of a website! It has parent trunks and child branches and organises all of the files accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      You “manipulate the DOM” by using JavaScript, which is what makes a website interesting and dynamic! So Javascript uses the DOM to create all of the functions of a site.
    </p>

  <h2>Arrays and Objects ~ What's the difference?</h2>

    <p>
      Excellent Question! Both arrays and objects are ways to store and access a group of data, but you would use them differently for specific types of data. Simply put:
    </p>

    <p>
      An array is a numbered list typically used to count and order items.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objects are like containers that have names with varying attributes rather than a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      So it’s essentially two different easy to differentiate containers of data.
    </p>

  <h2>Functions:</h2>

    <p>
      Functions are another way to keep your code tidy and organised, without having to repeat yourself over and over. Think of them like a specific command task for your computer to run. Functions are like recipes! You tell the computer the ingredient, give it the specific instruction of to cook the ingredients, and the computer will give you the finished result. Voila! 
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope this helped you understand some basic JS jargon and now you can code away stress-free on your fluffy cloud.
